# Cerecetam Study on Aphasia in Stroke Patients

## Overview
Conducted a clinical study on the impact of Cerecetam—a nootropic drug—on aphasia recovery in patients with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Measured changes in speech, cognitive function, and side effects.

## Tools Used
- SPSS (for statistical analysis)
- Clinical Protocols
- Medical Literature Review

## Skills Demonstrated
- Clinical Trial Design
- Evidence-Based Research
- Pharmacological Analysis
- SPSS Statistical Testing
- Academic Publication Writing

## Project Steps
1. Designed the study protocol and defined patient inclusion/exclusion criteria.
2. Monitored patients through pre- and post-treatment phases.
3. Analyzed data using SPSS (paired t-tests and descriptive stats).
4. Evaluated speech recovery outcomes and drug safety.
5. Co-authored results for academic publication.

## Outcome
Cerecetam was found effective in improving speech functions with minimal side effects. The study supported further exploration into neurotherapeutics for aphasia recovery.
